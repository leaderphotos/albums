Leader Photos Read Me
================================================================================

Nigel's photos from his old-timey [Menalto Gallery]( http://galleryproject.org/ ) app now on GitHub.

You can click on the `albums` icon just above and page through all of Nigel's snaps one by one - using GitHub's wonderful show-the-data capabilities.

Or you can play with yet another photo grid gallery: [Albums]( ./albums/index.html )

The challenge:

Can we display what Nigel has seen in 3D in some innovative manner?
