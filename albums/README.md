================================================================================

[Nigel's photos]( http://nigeldickinson.com/gallery/albums.php ) from his old-timey [Menalto Gallery]( http://galleryproject.org/ ) app now on GitHub.

<span style=display:none; >You can click on the `albums` icon just above and page through all of Nigel's snaps one by one - using GitHub's wonderful show-the-data capabilities.</span>

You can play with yet another photo grid gallery: [Albums]( https://leaderphotos.github.io/albums/index.html#albums )

***

The challenge:

Can we display what Nigel has seen in 3D in some innovative manner?
